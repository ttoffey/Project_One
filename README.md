# Core Hypothesis
* Real estate value has a positive correlation to proximity to airports?
* Null: Airport proximity has no effect on real estate value.


# Data Sources & APIs

### [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps)

##### Questions to answer:

1. What is the general life expectancy for the surrounding areas of an airport?
  
2. How do airports affect the air quality of the cities that house them?

3. How does living near the airport affect the nearby geological climate and terrain?

4. How cities closer to airports comparable in economics status to those without any airports?

5. Are you smarter for living near an airport?
